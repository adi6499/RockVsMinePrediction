📌 Overview
This project uses machine learning to classify sonar signals as either rock or mine. By analyzing frequency-based features from sonar returns, the model helps distinguish between harmless geological formations and potentially dangerous underwater mines—critical for defense and marine safety applications.

🔍 Problem Statement
Sonar signals are used to detect objects underwater. However, distinguishing between natural formations (rocks) and man-made threats (mines) is challenging due to signal similarity. This project builds a binary classification model to automate sonar signal interpretation using 60 frequency-based features.
